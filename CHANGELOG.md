# Changelog

All notable changes to the **`react-native-nitro-markdown` package** are documented
in this file — API, behavior, types, and native/runtime changes that affect
consumers. Repo tooling, examples, and docs-only changes are intentionally left out.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
**Breaking changes are always listed first in each release section** so upgrades
stay safe.

## [0.11.0-superpower.4] - 2026-08-20

### Changes

- **Breaking change:** images, math (inline and block) and HTML blocks are
  now standalone blocks. Each renders a view, and a view nested in a run's
  text host is positioned by placeholder spans on Android, where selection
  degrades across it. Classification walks the tree, so a paragraph carrying
  an inline image or inline math is standalone too and keeps the dedicated
  renderers' layout path.
- **Breaking change:** the run host no longer declares `onSelectionChange`,
  and `react-native-nitro-markdown/testing` no longer exports
  `simulateRunSelection`. Nothing consumed either; the host contract is the
  Copy as Markdown menu action.
- `onCopyAsMarkdown` requires a native `runHost`. The default host — the
  platform's selectable text component — reports no selection range on
  either platform, so the callback could never fire; development builds now
  warn when it is set without a host.
- Node identity is reused across parses inside `<Markdown>`, so the
  documented "a streamed append re-renders only the still-growing tail run"
  now holds for the plain `<Markdown selectable>{text}</Markdown>` path, not
  only for a hand-wired `sourceAst`.
- `onCopyAsMarkdown` and `onLinkPress` are read through refs, so passing them
  as inline arrows no longer rebuilds the context value and re-renders every
  node of the document on each streamed chunk. `renderers`, `classifyBlock`,
  `textPrimitive` and `runHost` are read during render and still need stable
  identities.
- Copy as Markdown slices the text the parse offsets index, after
  `beforeParse` plugins have run. A length-changing plugin used to displace
  every offset and hand back the wrong substring.
- Soft and hard breaks carry their own source range inside a run, so a
  selection crossing a wrapped line copies those lines instead of snapping to
  the whole paragraph.
- A run renders the blank line between a container's block children, and
  indents a nested list by one level per level of nesting. Multi-paragraph
  blockquotes and list items no longer glue into one line.
- Run presentation matches the standalone renderers where a text tree allows
  it: heading weight and letter spacing are resolved the same way, and a
  blockquote's muted colour reaches the text inside it. A `styles` override
  is narrowed to the properties a nested span honours, and development builds
  name the view-only properties they drop.
- `mapSelectionToSource` clamps before checking for an empty range, so
  offsets that outrun the source return nothing instead of firing
  `onCopyAsMarkdown` with an empty string.
- `smartPunctuation` follows markdown-it's dash rules, leaving `--verbose` in
  prose alone, and threads the preceding character across nodes so a quote
  that inline markup pushed into its own node curls closed.
- The `./testing` entry point resolves to built artifacts like every other
  entry, and its helpers no longer type-import `react-test-renderer`: they
  take any rendered instance with `props` and `children`.
- The mock native parser matches md4c on CRLF input, loose lists, setext
  headings, and thematic breaks and tables that interrupt a paragraph.

## [0.11.0-superpower.3] - 2026-08-18

### Changes

- Standalone blocks are selectable within themselves in selectable mode:
  fenced code text and each table cell render through the injectable
  selectable host (`runHost`), each as its own selection scope. A selection
  still never crosses a standalone block.

## [0.11.0-superpower.2] - 2026-08-18

Fork release: selectable runs (spec 0001, mobile-react-app). Consumed as a
vendored tarball until the fork has a remote to pin as a git dependency.

### Changes

- **Breaking changes:** the math rendering peer dependency
  (`ratex-react-native`) is dropped outright, removing the autolinking
  workaround it required. Math nodes render as monospace text; parsing is
  unchanged.
- Selectable runs: `<Markdown selectable>` classifies top-level blocks as
  flowing or standalone (`classifyBlock` extends the default — tables and
  fenced code), merges adjacent flowing blocks into runs, and renders each
  run into one selectable host (`SelectableRunHost`; replaceable via
  `runHost`). Runs are memoization boundaries keyed by the source offset of
  their first block and compared on AST node identity, so streamed appends
  re-render only the still-growing tail run.
- Injectable inline text primitive (`RunText`, `textPrimitive` prop): the
  inline group wrapper and every inline span render through it, so custom
  renderers participate in a selection. Inline custom renderers must emit
  text spans, never views.
- Range-to-source mapping (`mapSelectionToSource`) and `onCopyAsMarkdown`:
  the host reports selection offsets plus source-annotated spans; the
  consumer receives the markdown source for exactly the selected range.
- `smartPunctuation`: typographic quotes/dashes/ellipses as a render-time
  transform over parsed text content (never a pre-parse plugin, which would
  disable incremental AST reuse).
- Testing entry point `react-native-nitro-markdown/testing`: a
  source-faithful mock native parser with real source offsets, and stubbed
  host simulation helpers for consumer suites.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-12

### Changes

- **Breaking changes:** the new default 10,000,000-character input limit rejects
  documents that were previously attempted without a JavaScript-side bound.
  This denial-of-service guard is retained; split larger documents or set a
  lower app-specific limit. The native hard cap cannot be raised.
- `extractPlainText` and `extractPlainTextWithOptions` preserve their AST
  fallback when the optimized native extraction method is unavailable or
  fails.
- Custom `onLinkPress` handlers continue to receive every href, including app
  routes and custom schemes. Only validated HTTP(S), mail, and telephone URLs
  reach the built-in `Linking` fallback.
- Native parse and session failures now surface as typed `MarkdownError`s with
  stable `code` (`input_too_large`, `parse_failed`, `invalid_json`,
  `native_unavailable`, `extraction_failed`, `buffer_limit`, `invalid_range`,
  `destroyed`) and `source` (`parse` | `extract` | `session` | `render`).
- Parse input is bounded: `ParserOptions.maxInputLength` (default 10,000,000
  characters) rejects oversized inputs before any native call; the C++ parser
  enforces the same hard byte cap and a 64 MB JSON output cap.
- `options.sourceOffsets: false` now skips building the UTF-16 offset map in
  the native parser entirely, not just the JSON fields.
- New image policy: `imageOptions.remoteImages: "deny"` disables remote image
  loading for privacy- and SSRF-sensitive apps.
- The parse AST cache is now scoped per `<Markdown>` instance with bounded
  hit/miss/eviction counters reported through `onParseComplete.cacheStats`.
- `MarkdownStream` supports `initialParseMode: "async"` so large initial
  content no longer blocks the first frame; `sourceAstDisabledReason` gains
  the `"initializing"` state.
- `defaultHighlighter` restricts keyword highlighting to fixture-backed
  languages (JavaScript/TypeScript family, Python, shell); other languages
  return a single default token.
- Accessibility: tables expose a `grid` role with a header summary label,
  image accessibility labels strip raw markdown markers, and parse errors use
  the new `errorText` prop (default unchanged).
- `onParsingInProgress` is deprecated: parsing is synchronous, so the callback
  had no in-progress window. Use `onParseComplete` or `MarkdownStream`'s
  `sourceAstStatus`.
- The incomplete wikilink branch in the native parser was removed; wikilinks
  are not a supported syntax.

### Fixed

- Native session methods retain the Nitro HybridObject receiver when wrapped
  for typed error handling, preventing proxy access failures at runtime.
- iOS framework builds import the Objective-C exception barrier through a
  Clang module map instead of an unsupported Swift bridging header.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-30

### Changes

- **Breaking changes:** `parseMarkdown` and `parseMarkdownWithOptions` now throw
  when the Nitro module is unavailable, native parsing fails, or native output
  is invalid JSON. Headless consumers that relied on an empty-document fallback
  must migrate to `try`/`catch` and handle these errors explicitly.
- `<Markdown>` and `<MarkdownStream>` report native parse failures through
  `onError(error, "parse")`; failed stream updates retain the last valid state
  instead of rendering partial or empty content.
- A nonzero native parser result now throws instead of returning a partial AST.
- `beg` and `end` source offsets now use JavaScript UTF-16 indices, matching
  `String.length` and `String.slice` for accented text and emoji.
- `sourceOffsets` now survives `<Markdown>` and `<MarkdownStream>` option
  normalization and participates in the parse-cache key.
- Nitro Modules compatibility is now `>=0.36.4 <0.37.0`; the example baseline
  is Expo SDK 57, React Native 0.86.2, React 19.2.3, and RaTeX 0.1.14.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-15

_No breaking changes._

### Added

- `darkMarkdownTheme` — a ready-made dark theme preset (slate palette with
  dark-friendly syntax tokens) alongside `defaultMarkdownTheme` and
  `minimalMarkdownTheme`. Pass it via `<Markdown theme={darkMarkdownTheme}>` or
  compose with `mergeThemes`.
- `ParserOptions.sourceOffsets` (default `true`): pass `false` to
  `parseMarkdownWithOptions` to skip emitting per-node `beg`/`end` source offsets.
  For one-shot headless parses (search, indexing, validation) this yields a
  smaller AST and a faster native parse → JSI → `JSON.parse` round trip (~39%
  smaller JSON / ~35% faster on a 53 KB sample). Keep the default for
  streaming/incremental rendering, which relies on offsets to reuse stable nodes.

### Changed

- The native Markdown parser is now **reentrant** — each parse uses isolated
  state instead of a shared instance, so concurrent or nested `parseMarkdown` /
  `parseMarkdownWithOptions` calls can no longer interfere with each other.
- Block math (`math_block`) now renders without a surrounding card/surface —
  it's transparent and centered, so it blends with any background or theme
  instead of imposing its own surface color.

### Fixed

- The default renderer no longer silently drops raw HTML: with `options.html`,
  `html_block` and `html_inline` now render through dedicated, exported
  `HtmlBlock` / `HtmlInline` components (escaped monospace text by default) —
  themeable via `styles`, replaceable via `renderers`, and importable like every
  other built-in renderer.
- Block math no longer clips tall content (fractions, superscripts, matrices) —
  the math container reserves vertical headroom for the rendered glyphs.

### Security

- iOS now compiles the native parser with the same hardening flags as Android
  (`-fstack-protector-strong`, `-Werror=format-security`, `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`),
  adding defense-in-depth when parsing untrusted Markdown.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `MarkdownStream` now accepts `renderMarkdown` so consumers can keep Nitro-backed stream batching and incremental AST updates while rendering with their own Markdown component.
- Exported `useMarkdownStreamState`, `MarkdownStreamRenderProps`, `MarkdownStreamState`, `MarkdownStreamSourceAstStatus`, and `MarkdownStreamSourceAstDisabledReason` for headless stream renderers.

### Changed

- Strengthened package TypeScript checks with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and tightened optional prop construction so stream and renderer APIs omit absent fields instead of passing `undefined`.

### Fixed

- iOS `MarkdownSession.getTextRange()` and `replace()` now clamp finite out-of-bounds ranges before converting to `Int`, avoiding crashes from very large JS number inputs.
- `MarkdownStream` no longer rereads the full native session text on stable parent renders, reducing unnecessary bridge work during active streams.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Exported `MarkdownRenderers` as a public alias for `CustomRenderers` so custom renderer examples and IDE completions use a stable package type.

### Fixed

- `MarkdownStream` no longer throws when a pending stream update races with hook-owned session disposal during navigation.
- `MarkdownStream` now reuses stable parsed AST nodes across full-parse stream updates to reduce rerenders during markdown-heavy streams.
- `MarkdownStream` now keeps parser option identity stable by value, preventing unnecessary session resubscriptions when callers pass inline parser options.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- `useMarkdownSession(text)` now initializes and syncs hook-owned sessions with text, and `MarkdownStream` accepts the hook controller directly.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Exported `MarkdownNodeType`, `HeadingLevel`, and `TableCellAlign` for stricter AST typing in consumer code.

### Changed

- Updated the package baseline to Expo SDK 56, React Native 0.85.3, React 19.2.3, and TypeScript 6.0.3.
- Aligned `nitrogen` and `react-native-nitro-modules` at `0.35.7`.
- Updated native release baselines for Expo 56: iOS deployment target `16.4`, Android compile SDK `36`, and Android target SDK `36`.

### Fixed

- Removed stale lint suppressions that became warnings under the Expo 56 lint stack.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Aligned the podspec source tag with the repository's `v<version>` release tag format.
- Exported stronger public TypeScript types for renderer props, table options, image URL safety options, parse-complete results, and parse error phases.

### Fixed

- `useMarkdownSession` now disposes its native session on unmount after clearing the buffer.
- `MarkdownStream` now tolerates native subscription cleanup failures and avoids scheduling state updates after unmount.
- iOS `MarkdownSession` now locks `memorySize` reads and clears listener/buffer storage through `dispose()`.
- iOS `MarkdownSession.replace()` now matches Android by rejecting invalid ranges and reporting clamped listener ranges for out-of-bounds replacements.
- Built-in renderers now expose basic accessibility semantics for headings, links, images, and task items.
- Built-in image rendering now rejects unsafe URL protocols by default and supports explicit protocol/host allowlists.
- Virtualized markdown now defaults `removeClippedSubviews` to Android-only unless explicitly configured.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- RaTeX is now the package math renderer for `math_inline` and `math_block`.

### Changed

- Removed the public math-renderer backend selector; package math rendering now uses RaTeX.
- Aligned `react-native-nitro-modules` to `0.35.6`.
- Removed the stale `@types/react-native` package dev dependency; React Native provides its own types.

### Fixed

- iOS pod header search paths now use CocoaPods array values instead of a joined quoted string, preventing Swift driver failures such as `unknown argument: '-isystem'` in Expo 55/56 builds.
- Native `MarkdownSession` buffer limits are now enforced consistently across iOS and Android `append`, `reset`, and `replace` calls.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-05-05

### Changed

- Aligned the `react-native-nitro-modules` peer dependency floor with the documented `>=0.35.5` requirement.

### Fixed

- `MarkdownStream` now falls back to a full session text read when the native range-read fast path throws during append or reset-like updates.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Wide display math now stays within the markdown viewport and can be panned horizontally on iOS and Android.
- Math SVG sizing now handles MathJax `ex` dimensions, preventing oversized equations from clipping without a usable horizontal viewport.
- `MarkdownStream` docs now clarify that `updateIntervalMs` only applies to `updateStrategy="interval"` and is ignored by `"raf"`.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Headless parsing helpers return the documented empty-document fallback when native parser calls throw or return invalid JSON.
- Plain-text fallback extraction now preserves code, math, and HTML block text when parser output stores block text in child nodes.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- `Markdown` `parseCache?: boolean` prop (default `true`) to control internal parse-result caching for repeated markdown inputs.

### Changed

- Clarified plugin behavior when `sourceAst` is provided: `beforeParse` hooks are skipped, while `afterParse` hooks still run on the supplied AST.

### Fixed

- Parse-cache hits now verify the cached source text before reuse and clone the cached AST before handing it to plugin or transform code.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `ParserOptions.html` opt-in flag for native `html_inline` and `html_block` parsing. HTML remains disabled by default and still requires custom renderers.

### Changed

- Upgraded Nitro Modules and Nitrogen to `0.35.4`; peer dependency floor is now `react-native-nitro-modules >=0.35.4`.
- Cached default renderer style sheets and memoized code highlighting work in hot render paths.
- Migrated `nitro.json` to the current Nitro autolinking schema.

### Fixed

- `Markdown` now re-runs the parse/plugin pipeline when the `plugins` prop changes.
- Android `HybridMarkdownSession` now rejects infinite range values before range slicing or replacement.
- Native Android and iOS build inputs now exclude standalone C++ test sources.
- Image rendering now avoids post-unmount dimension updates during virtualized list recycling.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Android**: Added `consumer-rules.pro` with explicit `-keep` rules for Nitro Hybrid Object classes and `Func_*` JNI wrappers — prevents R8 full-mode stripping in release builds.
- **Android**: `HybridMarkdownSession.append()` now enforces a 10 MB buffer limit to prevent OOM.
- **Android**: `highlightPosition` getter is now synchronized; added `@GuardedBy` annotations throughout `HybridMarkdownSession`.
- **Android**: `HybridMarkdownSession` now implements `onDestroyed()` + `finalize()` to clear listeners and prevent post-destroy callbacks.
- **Android**: `NitroMarkdownPackage` uses lazy native init so a `System.loadLibrary` failure does not crash ClassLoader initialization.
- **Android**: CMake version range (`3.18.1...3.28`) and Release/Debug compiler optimization flags.
- **iOS**: `HybridMarkdownSession.replace()` now uses `NSMutableString.replaceCharacters(in:NSRange:)` for UTF-16-consistent indices, matching all other session methods.
- **iOS**: `notifyListeners()` is called outside the `NSLock` scope in all mutating methods, preventing potential deadlock when a listener calls back into the session.
- **iOS**: Added `isFinite` guards in `getTextRange()` and `replace()` to reject NaN/Infinity inputs.
- **C++**: All five md4c callbacks (`enterBlock`, `leaveBlock`, `enterSpan`, `leaveSpan`, `text`) are now `noexcept` with `try/catch(...)` — prevents undefined behavior from C++ exceptions escaping a C callback boundary.
- **C++**: JSON size estimation uses overflow-safe arithmetic with a 64 MB cap.
- **JS/TS**: `MarkdownParserModule` creation is now wrapped in try/catch with `__DEV__` logging; `parseMarkdown`/`parseMarkdownWithOptions` return an empty document AST on failure instead of throwing.
- **JS/TS**: `plugins` added to `useEffect` dependency array in `MarkdownStream`.
- **JS/TS**: `onLinkPress` result is wrapped with `Promise.resolve()` to support both sync and async handlers.
- **JS/TS**: Package exports are now explicit named exports; `sideEffects: false` set for tree-shaking.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Android: `NitroMarkdownPackage` extends `BaseReactPackage` instead of deprecated `TurboReactPackage`.
- Android: `cpp-adapter.cpp` now uses `facebook::jni::initialize` + `registerAllNatives()` instead of the deprecated `initialize(vm)` wrapper.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- `Markdown` `onError` callback for structured error reporting during parse and plugin pipeline phases. Receives `(error: Error, phase: 'parse' | 'before-plugin' | 'after-plugin', pluginName?: string)`.
- `MarkdownPlugin` `priority?: number` field — higher value runs first; default is `0`. Plugins are stable-sorted by priority before execution.
- `Markdown` `tableOptions` prop: `minColumnWidth` (default `60`) and `measurementStabilizeMs` (default `140`) for per-instance table layout tuning.
- `Markdown` `highlightCode` prop — set to `true` for built-in syntax highlighting, or pass a custom `CodeHighlighter` function for full control.
- Built-in regex-based syntax highlighter (`defaultHighlighter`) covering JS/TS, Python, and Bash. Renders code token spans using `codeTokenColors` theme values.
- `MarkdownTheme.colors.codeTokenColors` — per-token color map (`keyword`, `string`, `comment`, `number`, `operator`, `punctuation`, `type`, `default`). Defaults provided in `defaultMarkdownTheme`.
- `stripSourceOffsets(node)` headless utility — recursively removes `beg`/`end` source position fields for compact AST serialization.
- `MarkdownSession.reset(text)` — replaces full buffer content and emits a full-range change event.
- `MarkdownSession.replace(from, to, text)` — partial buffer mutation; returns new total UTF-16 length.
- `NodeStyleOverrides` is now a discriminated type map: text-type nodes accept `TextStyle`, view-type nodes accept `ViewStyle`. Prevents mismatched style shapes at compile time.
- New exports: `defaultHighlighter`, `CodeHighlighter`, `HighlightedToken`, `TokenType`.

### Changed

- Upgraded to Nitro Modules `0.35.0`, Expo SDK 55, React Native 0.83.2, React 19.2.0.
- iOS minimum deployment target raised to `15.1` (aligns with Expo SDK 52+, New Architecture only).
- Peer dependency `react-native-nitro-modules` range changed from `"*"` to `">=0.35.0"`.
- `useMarkdownSession` now exposes `reset(text)` and `replace(from, to, text)` alongside existing `clear()`.
- Table renderer internals refactored into sub-modules (`types`, `utils`, `reducer`, `cell-content`) — no behavior change.
- Bundle size budgets added via `size-limit` (main ≤40 kB CJS/38 kB ESM, headless ≤8 kB CJS/7 kB ESM).

### Fixed

- Android: `NitroMarkdownPackage` now calls `NitroMarkdownOnLoad.initializeNative()` instead of the deprecated `System.loadLibrary("NitroMarkdown")`, fixing a startup crash on Nitro 0.35.0.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- `Markdown` now supports `astTransform` for consumer-side AST transforms between parse and render.
- `onParseComplete` now receives the transformed AST (when `astTransform` is provided).
- Package index exports `AstTransform`, `MarkdownProps`, and `MarkdownStreamProps`.
- `Markdown` plugin pipeline via `plugins` prop:
  - `beforeParse(markdown) => markdown`
  - `afterParse(ast) => ast`
- `Markdown` `sourceAst` prop to render a pre-parsed AST and skip native parse.
- `MarkdownStream` `incrementalParsing` prop (default `true`) for append-optimized stream AST updates.
- `Markdown` large-document virtualization controls:
  - `virtualize`
  - `virtualizationMinBlocks`
  - `virtualization` (FlatList tuning)
- `MarkdownSession` range-based mutation API:
  - `append(chunk)` now returns new text length
  - `getLength()`
  - `getTextRange(from, to)`
  - `addListener((from, to) => void)`
- Native parser plain-text helpers:
  - `extractPlainText(text)`
  - `extractPlainTextWithOptions(text, options)`
### Changed

- Table renderer now uses immediate estimated column widths and refines in background measurement, avoiding blank-table states when layout callbacks are delayed.
- Native parser JSON serialization path was optimized in C++ to reduce allocation/copy overhead during AST conversion.
- `Markdown` now uses an internal small LRU parse cache for repeated render inputs.
- `Markdown` parse cache now bypasses very large inputs to avoid clone/cache overhead on long documents.
- Headless parser is JSON-only transport to keep API simple and avoid slower flat transport overhead.
- Table renderer now keeps column widths monotonic during stream updates to reduce visible layout jump/jitter.
- `MarkdownStream` now consumes native `(from, to)` ranges and prefers `getTextRange()` for contiguous appends, reducing full-buffer copies during streaming.
- `Markdown` `virtualize` now supports `"auto"` for threshold-driven virtualization.
- Table renderer now quantizes estimated column width updates to reduce stream-time layout thrashing.
- `Markdown` now computes flattened text lazily only when `onParseComplete` is provided.
- `Markdown` render path now memoizes `NodeRenderer` and virtualization callbacks to reduce repeated work in large documents.

### Fixed

- Package `prebuild` script now uses `bun run codegen` (no npm invocation).
- Table rendering race condition on iOS where measurement-phase timing could prevent visible table render.
- Stream incremental parser now correctly falls back to full parse when fenced code closing markers are split across chunks.
- Stream table rendering now reduces visible jump by applying coarser width estimate update steps during fast chunk append cycles.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-09
