# Troubleshooting

### "Native module not found" / parser throws on first call

The native build did not link the module. Re-run `bunx expo prebuild` (Expo) or
`pod install` (bare), then rebuild the app. Nitro modules cannot load in
**Expo Go** — use a development build.

### Math renders as plain text

That is the built-in behavior: the package ships no math typesetting engine, so
`math_inline` and `math_block` nodes render their source as monospace text. To
typeset math, pass your own `math_inline` / `math_block` custom renderers — see
[customization](./customization.md).

### Math does not render at all

Check that `options.math` is enabled (it is by default) and that the source uses
`$…$` / `$$…$$` delimiters.

### Streaming updates too often / janky

Use `updateStrategy="raf"`, or `updateStrategy="interval"` with
`updateIntervalMs` around 50–100 ms. See [streaming](./streaming.md).

### Plugin changes don't appear incremental

A `beforeParse` plugin forces a full parse by design, which disables incremental
AST reuse. `sourceAstStatus` becomes `"disabled"` in that state.

### Streaming parse failed

`MarkdownStream` reports parser failures through `onError(error, "parse")`.
Failed updates preserve the last valid stream state. An initial failure exposes
`sourceAstStatus: "disabled"` with `sourceAstDisabledReason: "parse-error"`.

### Long document feels heavy

Enable [virtualization](./usage.md#long-documents-virtualization):
`virtualize="auto"` when `<Markdown>` is the primary scroll container.

### Web build fails on import

Web is not supported — the parser needs Nitro Modules (JSI). Guard imports
behind `Platform.OS !== "web"` or a `.native.tsx` entry.

### Links don't open / open the wrong way

Provide `onLinkPress(href)` and call `Linking.openURL` yourself; return `false`
to suppress the default behavior.
